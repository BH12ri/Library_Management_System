# Library_Management_System

The proposed software product is the Library Management System (LMS). The system aims at making the task of library easy. The software keeps track of all the information about the books in the library, details of the issues, students, librarian, delay and much more. The project is totally built at an administrative end and thus only the admin is guaranteed the access. The scope of the project is to build an application program to reduce the manual work for managing the Libraryâ€™s book issue system. The system contains a database where all the information will be stored safely.
